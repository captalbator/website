I've been reading a lot of blogs about many different topics lately and I decided I might try making my own.
This is an attempt at making something that I would enjoy reading (or at the very least skim through) and I hope you will enjoy it too.

As a passionate programmer, you can expect this blog to be mostly about programming.
Whether it be games, tools, or small weekend projects, I'll post what I think would be interesting to other people.
Now, I'm not very good at writing, so don't expect anything exceptional in here.
I earnestly hope I get better at it while making this blog (for both our sakes), but no promises there.
