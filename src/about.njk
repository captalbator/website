  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am Antoine Gallien, a programmer from Canada. I've always been passionate about programming, and I am currently studying computer science in university. I mainly write code related to video games, but I also occasionally dabble in other projects such as web development &ndash; like  this blog &ndash; and tools to help me make games.</p>
  <p>On this blog I'll post about anything and everything I find interesting enough to write a post on. This includes, but is not limited to: video game programming, video game design and tools programming.</p>
  <p>I use <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> as my main operating system and I write my code in <a href="https://neovim.org/">Neovim</a> using the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> terminal. I also have a MacBook Air M2 for schoolwork.</p>
